# train-scheduler

Train Scheduler page allows a user to add trains and submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes

After submission the user will then see their train displayed as the following:
Train Name
Destination
Frequency (mins)
Next Arrival
Minutes Away

The above will calculate when the next train will arrive - this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times, data stored in Firebase.
