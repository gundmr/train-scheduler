# Train Scheduler 
* Train Scheduler page allows a user to add trains and submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes

* After submission the user will then see their train displayed as the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination
    * Frequency (mins)
    * Next Arrival
    * Minutes Away

The above will calculate when the next train will arrive - relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times, data stored in Firebase.
